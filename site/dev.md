If you are just looking to install plugins, then go back to the homepage and click the correct link (Distributions).

Since the AngelScript `import` statement does not work in TMInterface as of 2.0.1, this page is not yet in use.
Its intended purpose is to eventually list all the plugins that have an API that can be imported,
as well as said API in another page.
