# Point View

Visualizes the point from the built-in Single Point bruteforce mode.

## Installation

- [v2.1.0a](https://github.com/Sai-Moen/TMInterface-AS-SaiMoen/releases/download/v2.1.0a_small/point_view.zip)

## Guide

You can find the settings for this plugin in a settings page.
To find it, open the TMInterface settings, and look below all the built-in settings pages.

To enable it, tick the checkbox at the top of the page.

An object will appear at the point.
- In v2.1.0, this is done by placing a trigger.

If you need to get rid of the trigger, then untick the checkbox.

### Size

This setting changes how big the object around the point is.
