# Distributions

A plugin might include a README file, or I will try to document the plugins on their respective release pages.

## Note on plugin versions

Before listing the links to each plugin's page,
I would also like to note that the versions of TMInterface listed are not always required.
It could also just be the version on which the plugin was developed,
so maybe a certain version of the plugin will work on an older version of TMInterface.
Similarly, an older plugin has a decent chance of still working on newer versions of TMInterface (depending on its API usage).
