# HyperSpeed

Save State Management.

## Installation

- [v2.1.1a](https://github.com/Sai-Moen/TMInterface-AS-SaiMoen/releases/download/hyperspeed_v2.1.1a/hyperspeed.zip)

## Guide

When 'Enable HyperSpeed' is checked, it will try to use a savestate if one is loaded,
otherwise it will just speed towards the Rewind Time as fast as possible.

When 'Use Save State File' is checked, it will allow you to load a file from the States folder.
The filename is the file it tries to load/save from/to.
Pressing the save button will make you give up the current race,
and will overwrite the save state file with the inputs and state at the Rewind Time,
when the current inputs are played from the start (this will also happen as fast as possible).

As of writing, not using a save state file will cause the inputs at the Rewind Time to be released for some reason.
It is recommended to use a save state file on v2.1.1a.
