# Calculator

A command-line calculator.

## Installation

- [2.0.1.0](https://github.com/Sai-Moen/TMInterface-AS-SaiMoen/releases/download/pre_docs/calculator.as)

## Guide

There are two commands:

### calc_expr

This one calculates like a normal calculator.
For calculating with time values, use `calc_time`.

### calc_time

This one parses numbers as timestamps, and logs a time back instead of just a number.
It's pretty much the same as `calc_expr`, except that numbers are parsed and logged as timestamps.
