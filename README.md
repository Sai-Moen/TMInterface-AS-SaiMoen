# TMInterface-AS
Collection of TMInterface AngelScript scripts; modules and standalone scripts.

## How to install
In any case you need to know where your TMInterface Plugins folder is.
It can be found in the ~/Documents/TMInterface folder, just like where your Scripts folder is.

### Standalone
Simply copy the file over to your Plugins folder directly.
You should end up with an AS file in the Plugins folder.

### Module
In this case you should end up with all of the scripts from the module inside of a folder in the Plugins.
If the module is distributed as a zip file, you should extract all the files into a normal folder, and then move that folder into the Plugins folder.
Extracting can be done with just Windows' builtin features, by right-clicking the zip file and clicking 'Extract All...' to extract the files to a folder.

## How to use
The standalone scripts will be documented in the standalone folder.
The modules will be documented inside their own folder, or not (in which case it's still a work in progress).
